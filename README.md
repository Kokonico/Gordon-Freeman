> hello gordon.

A simple slack slack bot for all your hl2 needs!

## how to use

1. have an emoji titled "half-life-2", set this to whatever reaction you want out of gordon
2. have a bot token, app token, and signing secret, set them to the environment variables `token`, `apptoken`, and `signing_secret` respectively.
3. add to your workspace and run `slack.py` (main is a webscraper for the quotes).
4. enjoy!
